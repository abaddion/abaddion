## Hi there 👋 I'm Barush!

I'm a **principal recruiter** with over 20 years of experience (gosh, I’m seasoned!), a **developer advocate**, and a builder passionate about empowering software engineers to create stunning and meaningful projects. My mission? To simplify talent acquisition just like great platforms streamline infrastructure.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- **IRIS (MVP)**: An innovative recruitment system that automates sourcing, personalises outreach, and streamlines pipelines with trained-by-humans AI-driven matching. Currently seeking pilot partners to redefine how developers and companies connect!
- Building a **developer-first recruitment platform** where portfolios and stories shine brighter than resumes, fostering transparency and authentic connections.
- Crafting recruitment strategies for high-growth startups to attract builders who share their vision.

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Deepening my understanding of deployment workflows to better support developers.
- Exploring AI and machine learning to enhance IRIS’s candidate-matching algorithms.
- Experimenting with new sourcing channels like DEV Community and Hacker News to find hidden talent.

### 👯 I’m Looking to Collaborate On
- Open-source projects that simplify developer tools or recruitment processes.
- Partnerships with startups to pilot IRIS and co-create the future of hiring.
- Hackathons or community events where I can share my expertise and learn from builders.

### 🤔 I’m Looking for Help With
- Feedback on IRIS’s MVP to make it the ultimate tool for developers (and job seekers) and hiring teams.
- Insights from engineers on building secure apps and reliable monorepo deployments to inform recruitment strategies.
- Connecting with designers to create a sleek UI for my recruitment platform.
